[AprilTag](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/)
- similar to ArUco marker, store 4/12/16 bits
- fast to detect in any viewpoint or lighting conditions
- black background/white foreground
- not a naturally occurring presentation (think rock stacking)  
- similar to QRCode, which stores 3kb..but..
- more data = more misinterpretation
- less data = higher accuracy in varying lighting/positioning
- CV or ML can act upon it
- import for computer vision systems
  - image processing pipelines
  - robotics
  - navigation   
  - object size estimation
  - distance measurement
  - camera calibration
  - 3D construction
  - Robotic navigation
